# YOLOv8 Object Detection Notebook

This repository contains a notebook that demonstrates how to use the YOLOv8 model for object detection tasks. The notebook leverages the `ultralytics` library and integrates with Google Colab for data storage and model execution.

## Project Structure

- **Notebook**: `yolov8_small_data.ipynb`
  - This notebook performs object detection using the YOLOv8 model.
  - Key operations include dataset loading, model setup, and inference.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

- `ultralytics==8.2.81`
- `torch==2.3.1+cu121`

These dependencies can be installed using:

```bash
pip install -r Requirements.txt
